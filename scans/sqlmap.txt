[#1] form:
POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/
POST data: login-username=&login-password=&login-remember_me=y&login-submit=Sign%20In
do you want to test this form? [Y/n/q] 
> Y
Edit POST data [default: login-username=&login-password=&login-remember_me=y&login-submit=Sign%20In] (Warning: blank fields detected): login-username=&login-password=&login-remember_me=y&login-submit=Sign In
do you want to fill blank fields with random values? [Y/n] Y
it is recommended to perform only basic UNION tests if there is not at least one other (potential) technique found. Do you want to reduce the number of requests? [Y/n] Y
[12:49:04] [ERROR] all tested parameters do not appear to be injectable. Try to increase values for '--level'/'--risk' options if you wish to perform more tests. If you suspect that there is some kind of protection mechanism involved (e.g. WAF) maybe you could try to use option '--tamper' (e.g. '--tamper=space2comment') and/or switch '--random-agent', skipping to the next form
